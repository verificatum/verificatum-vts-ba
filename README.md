### Self-contained big integer arithmetic library in pure TypeScript with zero dependencies. Complete documentation with explicit references to the literature for arithmetic algorithms makes it good teaching material.

## Usage

Clone this repository and compile TypeScript yourself with your
favorite options and target or grab one of the compiled JavaScript
files in `compiled/`.

This repository is *intentionally* minimalistic, since any user is
likely to embed our source into an application with their own tool
chain.

**Replace JSBN.** For users of Tom Wu's [JavaScript Big Integer
library (JSBN)](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/jsbn) we
provide a drop-in wrapper class with identical API. The main reasons
to switch to VTS-BA is that it is written in TypeScript with modern
language constructs, and is more robust, thoroughly tested and
documented, but it is faster as well.

JSBN lacks proper documentation. Thus, although our class is a trivial
wrapper we rely on users to give feedback if we implemented anything
differently.

*Benchmarks.* Modular exponentiation is the most relevant
operation. The following graph summarizes the running times of modular
expoentiation in Node on our machine for: (1)
[JSBN](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/jsbn), (2) pure
TypeScript VTS, (3) VTS with a snipped of WebAssembly, and (4) the
Rust library [num-bigint](https://github.com/rust-num/num-bigint)
compiled to WebAssembly. For larger bitlengths VTS is faster than
num-bigint.

## Prerequisites

Installation instructions are given for Ubuntu 22.04. Adapt as needed.

```
# Building tools.
sudo apt install make

# Most recent version of node.
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_current.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs

# TypeScript globally.
sudo npm install -g typescript

# Install NPM development dependencies.
npm i

```

## Source Code

The source code is derived from a subset of the [Verificatum
TypeScript library
(VTS)](https://github.com/verificatum/verificatum-vts) repository and
found in `src/`. The files with the suffix `.dts` are not stand-alone
compilable TypeScript files. They are indended to be appended to the
library to build and run the test suite as explained in `Makefile`.

The postfix of each file indicates if pure TypeScript used, or
WebAssembly is used for the `muladd_loop` function. It also gives the
wordsize used internally, e.g., the postfix `p30` means that pure
TypeScript is used and that the wordsize is 30 bits. Both are internal
properties and should only influence running time and memory
requirements. The version with WebAssembly is roughly twice as fast
for large integer exponentiation, but it allocates complete pages of
memory.

## Contributing

You should feel free to submit pull requests to this repository, but
any good suggestions are then adopted in
[VTS](https://github.com/verificatum/verificatum-vts) and released
under MIT License in this repository whenever it is updated.

## Remarks

**Documentation.** Unfortunately it seems impossible to make tsdoc
render namespace comments correctly. If you know how to do this, then
please let us know. We refer the user either to the code or the
documentation generated from modules in [Verificatum TypeScript
library (VTS)](https://github.com/verificatum/verificatum-vts) for
technical information.

**Sponsor Us!** We need a sponsor to release
[VTS](https://github.com/verificatum/verificatum-vts) under MIT
License. Contact us if you are interested in this.
